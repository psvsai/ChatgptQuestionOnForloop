🔁 Basic For Loop Questions:
Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop`.

Print all even numbers between 1 to 20.

Print the multiplication table of 5 (from 1 to 10).

Print the factorial of a number using a loop (e.g., 5! = 5×4×3×2×1).

⚡ Questions with continue:
Print numbers from 1 to 10, but skip the number 5.

Print all numbers from 1 to 20, but skip the numbers that are divisible by 3.

Loop from 1 to 10, and for each number, print "Odd" if it’s odd, but skip printing if it's even using continue.

🛑 Questions with break:
Print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop the loop when you reach number 6.

Find the first number divisible by both 3 and 5 between 1 and 100, and break the loop once found.

Keep adding numbers from 1 upwards until the sum becomes more than 50. Use break to exit once the condition is met.

🧠 Bonus Challenge (Mix of Loop + Continue + Break):
Loop through numbers from 1 to 20.

Skip if the number is divisible by 4 (use continue)

Stop the loop if the number is greater than 15 (use break)

Print only the numbers that pass both conditions
